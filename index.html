			<h4>üóì &nbsp;Date Change</h4>
			<p>
				We were hoping that the situation in California would be more under control by our original date at the end of April, but let‚Äôs face it, it‚Äôs mid-January as of writing this and things are still a mess. As such, we‚Äôve decided to push our wedding back to the first weekend in October!
				<br><br>
				All other details will remain the same ‚Äî we will still be using the Avery Hotel as our venue for the weekend and we will be keeping all of the other COVID related safety precautions outlined below in place, because while we anticipate a minimized threat by October, the world will still not be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.
				<br><br>
				Our goal is still to make sure that we only proceed with the wedding in a manner that is safe for everyone involved. We'll continue to gauge how things are going as the event gets closer and if we need to take any additional precautions or make any further changes, we will keep everyone updated.
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h4>üò∑ &nbsp;COVID Precautions</h4>
			<p>
				We‚Äôve taken care to ensure that the least amount of people will be at the event as possible. We‚Äôve rented out the entire Avery Hotel and there will be no hotel staff onsite all weekend; we are DIYing the food and beverages so there will be no caterers onsite or handling any of the refreshments; the total number of people that will be present during the weekend is 45 at most.
				<br><br>
				To provide maximum flexibility there will be three options for participating in the weekend: 1) join us for the weekend, 2) join us just for the main event which will take place outdoors, or 3) join us virtually (livestream details to come).
				<br><br>
				As things get closer we'll evaluate if we need to take additional precautions, such as requiring testing to attend the wedding.

			<h4>üï¥ &nbsp;Dress Code</h4>
			<p>
				There is no dress code! Wear what you want ‚Äì we want everyone to be comfortable. That being said, we will have a professional photographer at the ceremony, so for that portion of the weekend please dress in a way that you‚Äôre comfortable living on for eternity in film. We trust all of you to look presentable and have no desire to force a bunch of formality on the situation.
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h4>üõå &nbsp;Lodging</h4>
			<p>
				We have rented out the entire historic Avery Hotel which is 5,700 square feet and has 27 beds. We are hoping that most of you will choose to stay at the hotel with us, and your stay will be free if you do so! Please note that some people will have to share rooms (we‚Äôll pair you with people you know). If you would prefer, you‚Äôre also welcome to arrange for your own accommodations off site ‚Äî there are a number of other hotels/motels in the nearby towns of Arnold and Murphy. Let us know your preference in the RSVP below!

			<h4>üçæ  &nbsp;Food & Drink</h4>
			<p>
				We‚Äôll be DIYing the food and beverages for the wedding in order to reduce the total number of people onsite and ensure there are no outside people (caterers/bartenders) handling anything.
				<br><br>
				Max loves to cook, so he is going to prepare two meals for everyone ‚Äî dinner on Friday and Saturday. In order to minimize the amount of work that Max has to do on the day of his wedding, he‚Äôs going to prep everything ahead of time and a few people might get tasked to pop things in and out of the oven on the day of the wedding.
				<br><br>
				We will also be providing a serve-your-own brunch on Saturday and Sunday.
				<br><br>
				Now for the fun stuff, alcohol! We‚Äôre going to batch make a few of our favorite cocktails, provide a variety of beers and wines, as well an entire rainbow of hard liquors and mixers. That being said, we encourage you to bring a bit of your poison of choice if you prefer something specific. (Our thought is that if we bring a bunch, and you bring a little, then everyone will get to drink what they want, and we shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about running out of anything.)
