			<h4>üêò COVID</h4>
			<p>
				So first things first, let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room: COVID-19. 
				<br><br>
				We‚Äôre hoping that the situation in California will be more under control by the end of April and that we‚Äôll all be able to gather safely and confidently to celebrate our wedding.
				<br><br>
				We‚Äôve also taken care to ensure that the least amount of people will be at the event as possible. We‚Äôve rented out the entire Avery Hotel and there will be no hotel staff onsite all weekend; we are DIYing the food and beverages so there will be no caterers onsite or handling any of the refreshments; the total number of people that will be present during the weekend is 45 at most. 
				<br><br>
				We will be continuously evaluating the situation as we get closer to the date and if we need to take additional precautions, pare down the number of people who are there, or outright cancel, we will do that. Our plan is to make sure that we only proceed with the wedding in a manner that is safe for everyone involved or not at all. 
				<br><br>
				To that end, we will keep everyone in the loop and up-to-date if we need to make any changes to the event, but for now we are going to proceed as though we can host the wedding as outlined below!

			<h4>üï¥ Dress Code</h4>
			<p>
				There is no dress code! Wear what you want ‚Äì we want everyone to be comfortable. That being said, we will have a professional photographer at the ceremony, so for that portion of the weekend please dress in a way that you‚Äôre comfortable living on for eternity in film. We trust all of you to look presentable and have no desire to force a bunch of formality on the situation.
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h4>üéÅ Registry</h4>
			<p>
				We will not be registering anywhere. Since we will be moving a few months after the wedding we figure registering for a bunch of stuff will just give us more things to move. If you would like to give us a monetary gift for our honeymoon or future life, we would really appreciate it ‚Äî but we‚Äôre after your presence, not your presents.

			<h4>üçæ  Food & Drink</h4>
			<p>
				We‚Äôll be DIYing the food and beverages for the wedding in order to reduce the total number of people onsite and ensure there are no outside people (caterers/bartenders) handling anything.
				<br><br>
				Max loves to cook, so he is going to prepare two meals for everyone ‚Äî dinner on Friday and Saturday. In order to minimize the amount of work that Max has to do on the day of his wedding, he‚Äôs going to prep everything ahead of time and a few people might get tasked to pop things in and out of the oven on the day of the wedding.
				<br><br>
				We will also be providing a serve-your-own brunch on Saturday and Sunday. We‚Äôll set stuff out if everyone wants to eat together, but these meals will be a casual graze at your own discretion type situation.
				<br><br>
				Now for the fun stuff, alcohol! We‚Äôre going to batch make a few of our favorite cocktails, provide a variety of beers and wines, as well an entire rainbow of hard liquors and mixers. 
				<br><br>
				That being said, we encourage you to bring a bit of your poison of choice if you prefer something specific. (Our thought is that if we bring a bunch of alcohol, and you bring a little bit of alcohol, then everyone will get to drink what they want, and we shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about running out of anything.)

			<h4>üõå Lodging</h4>

Please note that some people will have to share rooms (we‚Äôll pair you with people you know). If you would prefer, you‚Äôre also welcome to arrange for your own accommodations off site ‚Äî there are a number of other hotels/motels in the nearby towns of Arnold and Murphy.
